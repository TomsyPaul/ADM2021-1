Dear Students,

This is a sample Repository for demonstration of Git

a)Form groups of two or three
b)Fork the repository to your account
c)Then Clone your repository
d)Pull this master to your master to update changes somebody might have made since you forked
e)Add your details to developers.txt
f)Push your master to your repository
g)Create a PR to merge your master to this master

Each of you merge the PR created by your team mate.

At the end, all of you should have 
  1. Created one PR
  2. Merged one PR
  3. Your name stored in Developers.txt

If there are merge conflicts, resolve them, so that nobody's details are lost.

Wish you a great gitting..!!
